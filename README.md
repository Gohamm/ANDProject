## Converter App

### Brief Description:
The Application will revolve around the topic of converting units and currency. As a seasoned traveller, my most usefull tool when travelling have been apps
that allow me to convert currencies from foreign currencies, to a more relateable currency. It helps with putting prices into perspective, as well as it gives
me an idea of what im really spending. Moreover, the ability to also convert units such as feet to centimeters is also very usefull, as depending on where u travel
units may vary in which system they are meassured. In conclusion, the idea is to create an android application, which converts both units and currency in a simple design format. 


### Requirements:

* As a user I would like to convert Major currencies into DKK (did not work due to lack of knowlegde with databinding, however it is stuctured according to MVVM)
* As a user I would like to convert Imperial units into matrix units (sucessfully created a converter for the "length" measurements)
* As a user I would like to easily navigate between converting units and currency (Failed due to a bug I can not find)
* As a user I would like to know where to input units/ currencies  (The UI sucessfully guides the user to the input places)
* As a user I would like a simplistic UI to quicky convert units or currency on the go (the UI is simplistic. however, the UX is bugged)
